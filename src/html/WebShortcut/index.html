      <b>This website is still in the Alpha phase.</b>  There are a number of issues which are listed below.
      However, feel free to use it and please <a href="http://abeckus.com/contact.html">let me know</a> of any feedback you may have.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website allows you to launch and to convert web shortcut files.
      Web shortcuts are the files that are created by various operating systems when you save a link to a website.
      It supports shortcut files for Windows, Linux, and Apple.
      Specifically, these are files with the following extensions: .url, .website, .desktop, .webloc .
      This website is part of the <a href="http://beckus.github.io/WebShortcutUtil/">Web Shortcut Utility Suite</a>.
    </p>

    <!--p>
      It still requires a lot of cosmetic work, and could also use improvements to error handling.
      Unfortunately, this is a low piority for me, and I don't have plans yet to develop it any further.
      If you find the website useful and would like to see it improved, please
      <a href="http://abeckus.com/contact.html">let me know</a> (I guess if you hate it you can let me know too).
    </p-->
    
    <p>
      The source code for the website is <a href="https://github.com/abcodeworks/WebShortcut-Website">available here</a>. 
    </p>

    <h4>Known issues</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When converting shortcuts with unicode characters, the downloaded ZIP file will be corrupt.
          As a workaround, download the files individually.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the Android browser, the website will report an error for files that have unicode characters in the file name.
          This requires more investigation, but appears to be an issue with the browser itself. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Privacy</h4>
    <p>
      Not only are the shortcut files uploaded to a server, but they are sent unencrypted.
      If you have any privacy concerns, I suggest that you avoid this website.
